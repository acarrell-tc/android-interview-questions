### 1. what is Flow API

Flow API in Kotlin is a better way to handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.

### 2. why do we need flow when we have its alternative

Whether you should use Kotlin Flow or its alternatives depends on your specific requirements Flow API can be considered
if you need below these

- Working on a Kotlin project.
- Leveraging Kotlin Coroutines.
- Needing backpressure support.
- Focusing on clean functional code.
- Managing resource lifecycles and cancellations.

### 3. what is the difference between suspend function and flow API

The main difference is that suspend functions are designed for individual asynchronous tasks that have a single return
value. While Flow is designed for handling asynchronous data streams over time, that can emit multiple values.

The choice between suspend functions and Flow depends on the specific use case and whether you are dealing with single
asynchronous operations or continuous streams of data.

### 4. what is the difference between channel and flow?

The main difference between Channels and Flows is their purpose and the nature of the data they handle. Channels are
designed for synchronous communication between coroutines, typically involving single values or events, while Flows are
designed for handling asynchronous data streams that can emit multiple values over time.

### 5. what is the difference between a cold stream and a hot stream

- Cold streams are producer-controlled and provide independent data sequences for each subscriber. They generate data
  when a subscriber requests it.
- Hot streams are producer-independent and share the same data sequence among all subscribers. Data is generated
  continuously or in response to external events.

### 6. what is the flow API operator and their work

- map: Transforms each item emitted by the Flow into another item by applying a given function.
- filter: filter the emitted item on a given predicate.
- transform: Transforms each item into a new Flow and flattens the resulting Flows into a single Flow.
- flatMapConcat: Transforms each item into a Flow and concatenates the resulting Flows into a single Flow while
  preserving order.
- flatMapMerge: Transforms each item into a Flow and merges the resulting Flows concurrently.
- flattenConcat: Flattens a Flow of Flows into a single Flow, preserving order.
- flattenMerge: Flattens a Flow of Flows into a single Flow, merging items concurrently.
- onEach: Performs an action for each item emitted by the Flow without modifying the Flow itself.
- collect: Consumes and processes the items emitted by the Flow.
- onStart: Performs an action when the Flow starts emitting items.
- onCompletion: Performs an action when the Flow completes.
- catch: Handles exceptions emitted by the Flow and provides a fallback value or another Flow.
- retry: Retries the Flow when an exception is encountered, specifying the maximum number of retry attempts and a
  predicate to decide whether to retry.
- flowOn: Changes the context (dispatcher) in which the Flow emits items.
- buffer: Adds a buffer to the Flow, allowing it to handle backpressure.
- collectLatest: Ensures that only the results of the latest emission are processed, canceling previous work if it’s
  still in progress.

### 7. what is the difference between shared flow, live data, and state flow

- SharedFlow: Based on Kotlin Flow, supports multiple subscribers, buffering, and limited replay. Suitable for sharing
  mutable data among multiple components.
- LiveData: Android-specific, lifecycle-aware, and used primarily for observing data changes in UI components. Typically
  used with a single observer and doesn’t support replay.
- StateFlow: Based on Kotlin Flow, emits data continuously, typically used with a single collector. Suitable for
  managing immutable state within an application and often used with Kotlin Coroutines.

### 8. What is Kotlin Flow, and how does it differ from other asynchronous programming approaches in Kotlin?

Kotlin Flow is a part of the Kotlin standard library for handling asynchronous data streams. It differs from other
approaches like callbacks or RxJava in that it provides a more structured and declarative way to work with asynchronous
data. It integrates seamlessly with Kotlin Coroutines, allowing you to write asynchronous code in a sequential and
readable manner.

### 9. Explain the difference between cold and hot flows in Kotlin Flow. Provide examples of scenarios where you might use each.

Cold flows start emitting data when a collector (subscriber) is attached. Each collector receives its own sequence of
data. Hot flows, on the other hand, emit data continuously, regardless of whether there are active collectors. Use cold
flows when you want independent data sequences (e.g., user search queries). Use hot flows for scenarios where you want
to broadcast data to multiple subscribers, such as sensor data.

### 10. What is backpressure, and how does Kotlin Flow handle it?

Backpressure occurs when the producer emits data faster than the consumer can process it, potentially causing resource
or memory issues. Kotlin Flow handles backpressure by allowing consumers to control the rate of data consumption.
Collectors can use operators like `buffer` to buffer data or `conflate` to handle backpressure by emitting the most
recent value.

### 11. When would you choose to use SharedFlow over StateFlow, and vice versa?

You would choose SharedFlow when you need to share mutable data among multiple subscribers and require features like
buffering or limited replay. StateFlow is ideal for representing a single source of immutable state that multiple
components can observe. It provides continuous updates without support for buffering or replay.

### 12. What is the purpose of the launchIn function in Kotlin Flow, and why is it useful?

The `launchIn` function is used to launch a coroutine that collects data from a Flow. It’s useful because it manages the
coroutine’s lifecycle and ensures proper cleanup when the Flow is no longer needed. This prevents resource leaks and
simplifies the code by handling cancellation and error propagation.

### 13. What is the purpose of the flattenConcat and flattenMerge operators in Kotlin Flow, and how do they differ?

Both operators are used to flatten a Flow of Flows into a single Flow. `flattenConcat` preserves the order of items,
while `flattenMerge` merges items concurrently. Use `flattenConcat` when order matters, and use `flattenMerge` when
concurrency is acceptable.

### 14. How do you ensure the proper cancellation of a Flow in Kotlin, and why is it important?

Proper cancellation of a Flow is ensured by canceling the collector coroutine when it’s no longer needed. It’s essential
to prevent resource leaks and ensure efficient resource usage, especially in long-running or infinite-flow scenarios.

### 15. How can you handle multiple concurrent network requests using Kotlin Flow, and which operators would you use for this?

You can use the `flatMapMerge` or `flatMapConcat` operators to handle multiple concurrent network requests. These
operators allow you to transform each item (e.g., a URL) into a network request and merge or concatenate the resulting
Flows of responses concurrently or sequentially.
