#### 1. What is an Android Service?

An Android Service is a component that performs long-running operations in the background, independently of
the user interface. It doesn’t have a user interface, and it runs in the background even if the app is not in the
foreground.

#### 2. Explain the difference between started services and bound services.

A started service is initiated by calling startService(), and it runs in the background until it completes
its task or is explicitly stopped. A bound service, on the other hand, allows other components to bind to it and
interact with it. It's stopped when no more clients are bound to it.

#### 3. How can you start a service in Android?

You can start a service using the startService() method, passing an explicit Intent that identifies the
service to be started.

#### 4. What is an IntentService, and how does it differ from a regular Service?

IntentService is a subclass of Service that handles asynchronous requests (expressed as Intents) on a worker
thread. It automatically stops itself when the work is done. Unlike a regular Service, you don’t need to handle
threads explicitly.

#### 5. Explain the lifecycle methods of a Service in Android.

The essential lifecycle methods of a Service are onCreate(), onStartCommand(Intent, int, int), and
onDestroy(). onCreate() is called when the service is created, onStartCommand() is called when the service is
started, and onDestroy() is called when the service is stopped.

#### 6. How can you communicate between a Service and an Activity?

You can use various methods such as binding the Service to the Activity using bindService(), sending
broadcasts, or using Messenger for inter-process communication.

#### 7. What is a LocalBroadcastManager, and when would you use it?

LocalBroadcastManager is a helper class to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects
