### Basics of Fragments:

#### What is a Fragment in Android?

A Fragment is a modular section of an Android activity, representing a part of the UI or behavior in an activity.

#### How is a Fragment different from an Activity?

An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface, while a Fragment is a reusable component within an
activity.

#### Explain the lifecycle of a Fragment.

Fragments have similar lifecycles to activities, including methods
like `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onDestroy`, etc.

#### What is the purpose of the onCreateView method in a Fragment?

`onCreateView` is where the Fragment creates its UI by inflating a layout. It returns the root view for the fragment's
UI.

#### How can you communicate between Fragments?

Communication between Fragments can be achieved through interfaces, shared ViewModel, or using the FragmentManager.

#### Explain the difference between FragmentTransaction add, replace, and remove methods.

* `add`: Adds a Fragment to the container without removing existing Fragments.
* `replace`: Replaces the existing Fragment with a new one.
* `remove`: Detaches an existing Fragment from the UI.

### Fragment Lifecycle:

#### What is the significance of onActivityCreated in the Fragment lifecycle?

`onActivityCreated` is called after onCreate and indicates that the activity's onCreate method has completed.

#### Explain the use of onSaveInstanceState in a Fragment.

`onSaveInstanceState` is used to save the current state of the Fragment before it is destroyed, allowing it to be
restored later.

#### What is the purpose of setRetainInstance(true) in a Fragment?

It retains the instance of the Fragment across configuration changes, like screen rotations, preserving its state.

#### Describe the scenario where onDetach is called.

`onDetach` is called when the Fragment is no longer associated with its activity.

### UI and Layout:

#### How can you dynamically add a Fragment to an activity?

Use FragmentManager to begin a transaction and then use add or replace methods to add the Fragment.

#### What is the purpose of setArguments in a Fragment?

It is used to pass data to a Fragment before it is attached, ensuring that the data is available during the Fragment’s
creation.

#### Explain the difference between FrameLayout and RelativeLayout in the context of Fragments.

* FrameLayout: Designed to hold a single child view, often used as a container for Fragments.
* RelativeLayout: Allows positioning of child views relative to each other or the parent.

#### How can you communicate between a Fragment and its hosting Activity?

Define an interface in the Fragment, implement it in the hosting Activity, and then use it to communicate.

#### What is the purpose of setHasOptionsMenu(true) in a Fragment?

It indicates that the Fragment has menu items to contribute, and it will receive callbacks to create the options menu.

### Fragment Transactions:

#### How can you perform a FragmentTransaction?

Use FragmentManager to begin a transaction, perform desired operations (add, replace, remove), and then commit the
transaction.

#### What is the significance of addToBackStack in a FragmentTransaction?

It adds the transaction to the back stack, allowing the user to navigate back to the previous state using the device’s
back button.

#### Explain the difference between commit and commitNow in FragmentTransactions.

* commit: Schedules the transaction to be executed on the next frame.
* commitNow: Executes the transaction immediately on the calling thread.

#### How can you handle Fragment transactions in a ViewPager?

Use a FragmentPagerAdapter or FragmentStatePagerAdapter and manage transactions through the adapter.

#### What is the purpose of setTransition in a FragmentTransaction?

It sets the transition animation that will be played when the transaction is committed.

### Fragment Back Stack:

#### Explain the back stack in the context of Fragments.

The back stack is a record of Fragment transactions that allows users to navigate back to previous states using the
device’s back button.

#### How can you pop the back stack programmatically?

Use popBackStack() or popBackStackImmediate() methods of FragmentManager.

#### What is the difference between popBackStack and popBackStackImmediate?

* popBackStack: Asynchronously pops entries off the back stack.
* popBackStackImmediate: Synchronously pops entries off the back stack.

#### Explain how to handle back button presses within a Fragment.

Override onBackPressed in the hosting Activity or use OnBackPressedDispatcher within the Fragment.

#### What is the purpose of FragmentManager.BackStackEntry?

It represents an entry in the back stack, providing information about the FragmentTransaction.

### Fragment Navigation:

#### Explain the use of NavController in the context of Fragments.

NavController is a component of the Navigation component that helps navigate between Fragments and handle the back
stack.

#### How can you implement bottom navigation with Fragments?

Use BottomNavigationView along with the Navigation component to switch between Fragments.

#### Describe the purpose of setPrimaryNavigationFragment in a FragmentTransaction.

It sets the primary navigation Fragment, ensuring that its navigation events are considered the primary navigation
events.

#### What is the role of NavHostFragment in navigation within Fragments?

NavHostFragment is a container for hosting navigation graphs, facilitating navigation between Fragments.

#### How can you navigate between Fragments using the Navigation component?

Use the NavController to navigate to specific destinations defined in the navigation graph.

### Fragment Animation and Transition:

#### Explain the use of setCustomAnimations in a FragmentTransaction.

It allows you to set custom animations for entering and exiting the Fragment.

#### How can you implement shared element transitions between Fragments?

Define shared elements in both Fragments and specify the transition names. Use FragmentNavigator.Extras when navigating.

#### What is the significance of setAllowEnterTransitionOverlap in a Fragment?

It controls whether the enter transition overlaps with the exit transition of the previous Fragment.

#### Explain the use of FragmentTransaction.replace with shared element transitions.

replace can be used to replace Fragments while retaining shared elements and ensuring a smooth transition.

#### How can you customize the enter and exit transitions for a Fragment?

Override the onCreateAnimation method in the Fragment and return a custom animation.

### Fragment and ViewModel:

#### What is the role of ViewModel in the context of Fragments?

ViewModel helps store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, surviving configuration changes.

#### How can you share data between Fragments using a shared ViewModel?

Create a shared ViewModel and access it from both Fragments, observing data changes.

#### Explain the concept of ViewModel scope in a Fragment.

The ViewModel is scoped to the Fragment's lifecycle, ensuring that it is only retained as long as the Fragment is alive.

#### What is the purpose of by viewModels() delegate in a Fragment?

It is a property delegate that creates a ViewModel tied to the Fragment's lifecycle.

#### How can you handle communication between Fragments using ViewModel and LiveData?

Use a shared ViewModel with a LiveData object to observe changes in one Fragment triggered by another.

### Fragment Testing:

#### Explain the role of FragmentScenario in testing Fragments.

FragmentScenario is a part of the AndroidX Test library, providing a framework for testing Fragments in isolation.

#### How can you test Fragment transactions using FragmentScenario?

Use FragmentScenario to launch a Fragment and perform transactions, then use assertions to verify the results.

#### What is the purpose of launchFragmentInContainer in Fragment testing?

It launches a Fragment in a container for testing, allowing you to isolate and test specific Fragments.

#### Explain the use of FragmentScenario.launchInContainer with custom arguments.

It allows you to launch a Fragment with custom arguments for testing different scenarios.

#### How can you verify Fragment UI components in testing?

Use ViewMatchers and ViewAssertions from the Espresso testing library to interact with and verify UI components.

### Handling Configuration Changes:

#### How can you handle configuration changes in Fragments?

Use setRetainInstance(true), ViewModels, or handle configuration changes manually by saving and restoring state.

#### Explain the role of onConfigurationChanged in a Fragment.

onConfigurationChanged is called when a configuration change occurs, allowing the Fragment to respond accordingly.

#### What is the purpose of setAllowReturnTransitionOverlap in a Fragment?

It controls whether the return transition overlaps with the reenter transition of the previous Fragment.

#### How can you use onSaveInstanceState to handle configuration changes?

Save relevant data in onSaveInstanceState, and then restore it in onCreate or onCreateView.

#### Explain how to use onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance in a Fragment.

It allows you to retain custom non-configuration data across configuration changes.

### Handling Permissions:

#### How can you request permissions within a Fragment?

Use the requestPermissions method in the Fragment and handle the results in onRequestPermissionsResult.

#### Explain the use of shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale in permission handling.

It checks whether you should show UI with rationale for requesting a permission.

#### How can you handle the result of a permission request in a Fragment?

Override onRequestPermissionsResult and handle the results based on the granted or denied permissions.

#### What is the purpose of the Fragment.requestPermissions method?

It requests permissions from the user, showing the appropriate system UI.

#### How can you check if a permission is granted within a Fragment?

Use the ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission method to check the permission status.

### Fragment and UI Components:

#### How can you integrate a Fragment with a RecyclerView?

Create a Fragment containing a RecyclerView, and use an adapter to populate and manage the data.

#### Explain how to use the ViewPager with Fragments.

Use ViewPager along with a FragmentPagerAdapter or FragmentStatePagerAdapter to navigate between Fragments.

#### What is the significance of Fragment.setHasOptionsMenu(true) in relation to menu items?

It indicates that the Fragment contributes menu items, and onCreateOptionsMenu will be called.

#### How can you show a dialog within a Fragment?

Use the DialogFragment class to display a dialog within a Fragment.

#### Explain the role of onActivityResult in a Fragment.

It is called when an activity launched from the Fragment finishes and returns a result.

### Advanced Topics:

#### How can you implement a Master-Detail flow using Fragments?

Use a ListFragment for the master view and a detail Fragment for the detail view, adjusting layouts for different screen
sizes.

#### Explain the use of FragmentFactory in creating Fragments.

FragmentFactory allows you to customize the process of creating Fragments, useful for dependency injection.

#### What is the purpose of onMultiWindowModeChanged in a Fragment?

It is called when the multi-window mode changes, allowing the Fragment to adjust its UI accordingly.

#### Explain how to use FragmentBreadCrumbs for navigation.

FragmentBreadCrumbs provides a way to navigate backward through the Fragment stack.

#### How can you use FragmentStateManager to manage Fragment state?

FragmentStateManager is part of the AndroidX library, helping manage Fragment state in a consistent manner.

### Fragment Best Practices:

#### What are the best practices for using Fragments in Android development?

Best practices include using a single activity with multiple Fragments, following the Single Responsibility Principle,
and handling configuration changes properly.

#### Explain the benefits of using the Navigation component with Fragments.

The Navigation component simplifies Fragment navigation, handles the back stack, and provides a visual representation of
the app’s navigation structure.

#### How can you optimize Fragment transactions for better performance?

Use commitNow() for immediate execution, avoid nested transactions, and batch multiple operations into a single
transaction.
