#### 1. What is Retrofit, and how does it simplify the process of making network requests in Android applications?

Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java/Kotlin that simplifies the consumption of
RESTful APIs. It allows developers to define API endpoints and their request/response types using annotations, making
it easier to work with web services.

#### 2. Explain the purpose of the @GET annotation in Retrofit, and provide an example of its usage in defining a GET request.

The @GET annotation is used to define an HTTP GET request in Retrofit. It is applied to a method in an
API interface and specifies the relative URL for the endpoint. For example:

```java

@GET(“/posts/{id}”)
Call<Post> getPostById(@Path(“id”) int postId);
```

#### 3. What is the significance of the Converter interface in Retrofit, and how does it contribute to the conversion of request/response bodies?

The Converter interface is responsible for converting between HTTP request/response bodies and Java
objects. Retrofit uses converters like GsonConverterFactory to serialize and deserialize data between the app and the
server.

#### 4. How does Retrofit handle dynamic URL parameters, and what role does the @Path annotation play in this context?

Retrofit handles dynamic URL parameters using the @Path annotation. It allows developers to include
dynamic values in the URL, providing flexibility. For example:

```java

@GET(“/users/{username}”)
Call<User> getUser(@Path(“username”) String username);
```

#### 5. Explain the purpose of the Interceptor interface in Retrofit and provide examples of how it can be used to modify or log network requests.

The Interceptor interface allows developers to intercept and modify network requests and responses. It
can be used for tasks such as adding headers, logging, or modifying the request/response before reaching the server
or the app.

#### 6. Differentiate between Call<T> and Deferred<T> in Retrofit, and when would you prefer to use one over the other?

Call<T> is used for synchronous network requests, while Deferred<T> is used for asynchronous requests
with Kotlin's coroutines. Use Call<T> for synchronous operations and Deferred<T> for asynchronous tasks.

#### 7. How does Retrofit handle error responses from the server, and how can you customize the error handling process?

Retrofit treats HTTP error responses as exceptions. Developers can use the Callback interface or suspend
functions with Kotlin's coroutines to handle different HTTP status codes and customize error handling based on the
server's response.

#### 8. Explain the purpose of the @Query annotation in a Retrofit API method and provide an example of its usage in passing parameters in a GET request.

The @Query annotation is used to add query parameters to a URL in a Retrofit API method. It allows
developers to pass key-value pairs as parameters in a GET request. For example:

```java

@GET(“/search”)
Call<List<Item>> searchItems(@Query(“query”) String query);
```

#### 9. How does Retrofit support file uploads in API requests, and what annotations are commonly used for this purpose?

Retrofit supports file uploads using the @Part annotation. Developers can send files as parts of a
multipart request. Additional annotations like @Multipart and @PartMap are commonly used for this purpose.

#### 10. Explain the role of the RxJavaCallAdapterFactory and CoroutineCallAdapterFactory in Retrofit, and how they enable integration with RxJava and Kotlin coroutines, respectively.

RxJavaCallAdapterFactory and CoroutineCallAdapterFactory are used to enable integration with RxJava and
Kotlin coroutines, allowing developers to use reactive programming or coroutines for handling asynchronous network
requests.

#### 11. How does Retrofit handle the conversion of JSON responses to Java or Kotlin objects, and what role does the Converter.Factory play in this process?

Retrofit uses a Converter.Factory to convert between HTTP request/response bodies and Java or Kotlin
objects. For JSON serialization/deserialization, you'd typically use libraries like GsonConverterFactory.

#### 12. Explain the purpose of the @Headers annotation in Retrofit and provide an example of how it can be used to add custom headers to a request.

@Headers is used to add custom headers to a request in Retrofit. It can be applied at the method or
parameter level. For example:

```java

@Headers({
        “Cache-Control:max-age=640000”,
        “User-Agent:My-App”
        })
@GET(“/user”)
Call<User> getUser();
```

#### 13. What is the purpose of the @Url annotation in Retrofit, and in what scenarios would you use it?

@Url is used to dynamically specify the URL for a request. It can be applied to a parameter of a method
to override the base URL for that specific request. Useful when you need to construct URLs dynamically.

#### 14. Explain how to handle different response types (success and error) using Retrofit, especially when the server returns non-2xx status codes.

Retrofit treats HTTP error responses as exceptions. To handle different response types, you can use
Response<T> for both success and error cases or customize error handling by implementing your error model or using a
callback.

#### 15. What is the purpose of the @Streaming annotation in Retrofit, and how can it be used for handling large files or streaming responses?

@Streaming is used to indicate that the response should be streamed, which is useful for handling large
files. It prevents the entire response from being loaded into memory at once.

#### 16. Explain the differences between @Field, @FieldMap, @Query, and @QueryMap annotations in Retrofit, and provide use cases for each.

@Field and @FieldMap are used for form-urlencoded requests, while @Query and @QueryMap are used for
adding parameters to the URL in GET requests. Use @Field when sending form data and @Query when adding parameters to
the URL.

#### 17. How can you handle authentication in Retrofit, and what are the common methods for passing authentication tokens to API requests?

Authentication in Retrofit can be handled by adding headers to requests, typically using the @Header or
@HeaderMap annotations. Common methods include passing an authentication token in the header or using OAuth.

#### 18. Explain the use of the @FormUrlEncoded annotation in Retrofit, and provide an example of when it is necessary to use it.

@FormUrlEncoded is used to indicate that the request body will be in form-urlencoded format. It is
necessary when sending data in the body of a POST request using @Field or @FieldMap annotations.

#### 19. What is the purpose of the @DELETE annotation in Retrofit, and how can it be used to define a DELETE request in an API interface?

The @DELETE annotation is used to define an HTTP DELETE request in Retrofit. It is applied to a method
in an API interface, specifying the relative URL for the endpoint.

#### 20. Explain the role of the @Multipart annotation in Retrofit, and provide an example of how it can be used for sending multipart/form-data requests.

@Multipart is used to indicate that the request has a multipart body. It is applied to a method in an
API interface along with the @Part annotation for each part of the request, typically used for file uploads.

#### 21. Explain the purpose of the @Body annotation in Retrofit and provide an example of how it can be used for sending data in the request body.

@Body is used to define the request body for POST or PUT requests in Retrofit. It allows you to send
data in the request body, typically used for sending JSON objects. For example:

```java

@POST(“/users”)
Call<User> createUser(@Body User user);
```

#### 22. How can you implement logging of network requests and responses in Retrofit, and what are the common libraries or interceptors used for this purpose?

Logging of network requests and responses in Retrofit can be implemented using interceptors like
OkHttp’s HttpLoggingInterceptor. It allows you to log details such as headers, bodies, and timings.

#### 23. Explain the purpose of the @Part annotation in Retrofit, and provide an example of how it can be used for sending parts of a multipart request.

@Part is used to define parts of a multipart request when using @Multipart. It can be applied to
parameters of a method in an API interface. For example:

```java

@Multipart
@POST(“/upload”)
Call<ResponseBody> uploadFile(@Part MultipartBody.Part filePart);
```

#### 24. What is the role of the @Field annotation in Retrofit, and in what scenarios would you use it for sending form data in a POST request?

@Field is used to add form data to a POST request in form-urlencoded format. It is applied to
parameters of a method in an API interface. For example:

```java

@FormUrlEncoded
@POST(“/login”)
Call<ResponseBody> login(@Field(“username”) String username, @Field(“password”) String password);
```

#### 25. Explain how to handle token expiration and refreshing in Retrofit when dealing with APIs that use token-based authentication.
