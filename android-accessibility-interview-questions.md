```

### 7. What are the different ways to create and manage focus order in Android Accessibility?

In Android Accessibility, focus order management involves ensuring that users can navigate through UI elements
efficiently. There are four primary ways to create and manage focus order:

1. Default Focus Order: Android automatically assigns a default focus order based on the layout hierarchy. Generally,
   this works well but may require adjustments for complex layouts.

2. android:focusable attribute: Set this attribute to “true” in XML layout files to make a view focusable. Use “false”
   to prevent it from gaining focus.

3. android:nextFocus* attributes: Utilize these attributes (e.g., nextFocusDown, nextFocusUp) to explicitly define the
   navigation path between focusable views, overriding the default order.

4. Custom ViewGroups: Create custom ViewGroup subclasses and override methods like onRequestFocusInDescendants or
   getFocusables to control focus traversal programmatically.

5. TalkBack Order: For screen reader users, ensure proper reading order by using contentDescription and labelingFor
   attributes to provide meaningful information about each element.

6. Testing: Test focus order with accessibility services enabled, such as TalkBack or Switch Access, to verify smooth
   navigation for all users.
